        "review": "I had a major surgery last month. And he did really well. I hardly felt any pain. The environment was super. And I must say he knows his craft. Before the surgery I was worried about it. Some of my friends has bad experiences with dental surgery. I was really nervous. But Mr. Fibonacci cheered me up and the surgery was successfull."
